This repo backtests a few strategies I picked up on from a podcast I listened to on Barstool Sports.  The strategies described are meant to be more of a joke and one that they do not follow too closely but I wanted to see how it actually performed over the years.  The basic premise of the strategy is to look at the scorelines of football games and determine if the sportsbook sets the line near a 'Football Number'.  These numbers are 3,7,10,14,17,21 and so on.  The way football scoring works, all of these numbers are a combination of 3's and 7's, or field goals and touchdowns.  My goal was to study lines right near these numbers.  For example, let's say the line for a game is 6.5, where one team is favored to win by 6.5 or more points.  I wanted to figure out if you should take the underdog or favorite in that scenario.  Then, on the other side of the scenario, if the line is 7.5 points, which team should you pick.  I designed the analysis so you can choose a strategy say pick all the favorites when a line is 0.5 points below a football number and the underdog when the line is 0.5 points higher than the football number.  This is targeted to be a fun analysis and take a not so serious startegy and see if you can possibly turn it into a real strategy.  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or any extra analysis you want to try out with it!
